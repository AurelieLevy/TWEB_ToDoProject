# ToDo project
This project was done as part of the TWEB course of HEIG-VD (Yverdon, Switzerland).

The principle is simple. We relied on an application offering todo lists named Wunderlist. This application provides an API allowing developers to ling it with their own application. You can find this API here:

<center> <a href="https://developer.wunderlist.com/documentation">https://developer.wunderlist.com/documentation> </a></center>

Wunderlist is downloadable for  Mac, Windows, Android and iOS.

Our application is a gamification of the use of Wunderlist. When you finished a task, you win more or less coins, allowing you to buy images.

## How to use
First, you will need to download Wunderlist, then you will need to register. Be careful to remember your credentials, you will need it on our application.

Once you did this, you can go on the following url:

<center> <a href="https://remij1.github.io/#!/dashboard">https://remij1.github.io/#!/dashboard> </a></center>

Here, you will find two pages: ``` My photos``` and ```Shop```.

The first will show you the pictures you have already bought and the tasks you completed.  They are the tasks that provided you your gold.

The second is the shop where you will be able to buy others pictures.

At the top, you will find your name and the amount of gold you have earned.
